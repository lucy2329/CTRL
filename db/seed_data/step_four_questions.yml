    If you decide to withdraw from the study before genomic testing is performed and data is collected, 
    we will not continue. Any specimens will be disposed of or can be returned to the family upon request.

    If you withdraw after genomic testing is performed and data is collected, you can choose not to be told
    about the result. However, we will use any data already collected for research purposes unless you tell 
    us not to. If your data has already been shared, it may not be possible to retrieve or remove all your 
    data that has been collected as part of this study.
