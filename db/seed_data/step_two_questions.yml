    I understand what participation in this research study involves.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Re-analysing data from previous genetic testing:</b> We will 
    re-analyse the genomic data because scientific knowledge and 
    analysis tools improve quickly. This is often the first step
    before additional testing is considered.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Genomic Test:</b> You have been invited to take part in this
    study because you/your child have had genomic testing which did
    not find a cause for your/your child’s rare condition. If 
    re-analysing the data does not find a genetic answer, we will then
    use other genomic tests on genetic information from a saliva or
    blood sample from you and/or your close family members. Often we
    will be able to use DNA that is stored in the laboratory from
    your previous genetic testing in your family. However, sometimes
    we may ask you if it is ok to collect a new blood sample, 
    or possibly some other samples which are explained in more detail here. 
  description: |
    The The genetic information could be DNA, that makes up your genes,
    or RNA which is the message the gene codes for within cells.  If a
    gene change is identified that might be medically important, we will
    do protein studies and other tests to determine if the gene change
    affects its function. For these functional studies we may need a
    fresh blood sample or, other types of samples.  It is your choice
    which of those samples we take. Collecting and testing different 
    tissue samples increases the chance that we will be able to find 
    a genetic change that causes the rare condition in your family. 
    <b>You do not have to agree to all samples being collected in order
    to participate in the study.</b> The types of samples we may ask 
    you to collect include:<ul><li> skin, and/or</li><li> tissue 
    biopsy, and/or</li><li> urine.</li><li>
    <br>
    <br>
    Sometimes we find gene variants, but we do not know if they
    can cause a health or developmental condition. These are 
    called variants of uncertain significance. To make a diagnosis
    in your family, we may ask to take a skin biopsy from you or 
    your child. Studying how the gene change works in your or your 
    child’s skin cells can help us to understand if the change can 
    cause the rare condition in your family. Wherever possible, we 
    will collect these samples at the same time as any clinical procedures
    that are part of your or your child’s usual care.
    <br>
    <br> 
    <b>Health Information:</b> We will also collect health information
    about you, your child and other relevant family members, including
    names and dates of birth, family history, medical and developmental history.
    <br>
    <br> 
    <b>Result Return:</b> The results of the further genomic testing will
    be given to you during a scheduled appointment with your or your child’s
    treating specialist doctor, a clinical geneticist or a genetic counsellor.
    <br>
    <br>
    It may take a year or more for your test results to be available. 
    The genomic test may or may not provide a diagnosis (see section 6).
    Your clinical genetics team may arrange for clinical testing to confirm 
    the research result. This would be done in an accredited laboratory, 
    which will issue a separate diagnostic test report.

    I understand the possible benefits of taking part in this study.
    <br>
    <br>
    The results of genomic testing may help health professionals 
    involved in your/your child's care to better understand and manage
    your condition.
    <br>
    <br>
    Your family may benefit from this information as it might be possible
    for your doctor to give you more accurate information about the chance
    of having further children with the gene variant, or if other members
    of your family might develop the condition.
  description: |
    Sometimes, genomic test results may also provide information about the
    genetic risks of family members. Where appropriate, this may be used to
    help inform genetic counselling and testing of family members. This 
    information will be communicated to your family members by your local 
    clinical genetics team.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you decide to find out the results of your child’s genomic tests, 
    this may have implications for them in the future. For example, they
    may need to tell third parties about these test results. These third 
    parties could include insurance companies, employers, and financial or 
    educational institutions
    <br>
    This research may benefit others in the future, as the aim of this 
    study is to improve the welfare of patients and families affected 
    by rare genetic conditions.

    I understand the possible risks, side-effects, discomforts and/or 
    inconveniences of having samples collected.
    <br>
    <br>
    There are no major risks associated with collecting a new sample. 
    However, you or your child may feel some discomfort when the sample is
    collected. This depends on the type of sample collected.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Blood:</b> You/your child may feel a sting when the needle is put in the
    arm. We can use a cream to numb the skin before we take the blood.
  description: |
    <b>Skin Biopsy:</b>  A skin biopsy is generally a simple and safe 
    procedure using a local anaesthetic but there may be some bleeding 
    and/or bruising where the skin is taken, and some may experience minor 
    discomfort. The procedure will leave a small scar (5mm). In some cases, 
    infection may occur. If you or your child is having another procedure under 
    anaesthetic, we may ask if we can collect a skin biopsy at the same time to minimise
    the discomfort for you or your child.
    <br>
    <br> 
    <b>Tissue Biopsy:</b> If an extra procedure is needed to get a tissue sample 
    for genetic analysis, this will be performed by an appropriately qualified doctor.
    The approach used to obtain tissue samples may vary. There may be some bleeding,
    discomfort, or pain from the tissue biopsy. In some cases, infection may occur, 
    and some people experience fainting or distress. To minimise risks and discomforts,
    you or your child may receive local anaesthetics to numb the area of the biopsy. 
    Some surgical procedures require a general anaesthetic to make you or your child 
    unconscious during the procedure. We will only collect samples for this research 
    under general anaesthesia if you or your child already has the general anaesthesia 
    planned as part of their medical care.  Where possible, we will use stored tissue 
    samples from previous surgical procedures, or we may ask if we can collect a tissue 
    sample during a future planned procedure.
    <br>
    <br>
    Your/your child’s samples will be labelled with their code number only. It will not
    be possible for the testing laboratory to identify your child (de-identified). It is
    important to note that any samples sent overseas are not protected by Australian laws
    and regulations.
    <br>
    <br> 
    As part of this research study, your sample(s) will be stored indefinitely in 
    case further research may be needed to help find a diagnosis and/or to better 
    understand your health condition. Some samples may be used by the laboratory or 
    research study as a control sample. You can choose to have your samples removed 
    from storage at any time.
    <br>
    <br> 
    If you pass away and we are informed of this, we will seek advice from your next
    of kin about their wishes to store your data or samples. If the data is in a repository
    from which it can’t be extracted, we won’t be able to destroy that data.  If your
    next of kin indicates they are happy for the study to continue to store your samples,
    and an opportunity for future research arises, if you have consented to this, we will
    contact them to discuss reconsenting for this new research.   If your child passes
    away and you inform us, we will discuss with you your preferences for data and sample
    storage. Again, if this data is in a repository from which it can’t be extracted, we
    won’t be able to destroy that data.

    I understand the potential genetic testing issues for myself or my child.
    <br>
    <br>
    A genetic test has a number of potential results. These include an informative
    result that explains you or your child’s rare genetic condition, a negative or
    uninformative result where no genetic explanation is found, or an uncertain 
    result that we do not understand at this point in time. Sometimes, samples from 
    parents or other close relatives (usually siblings), may help us to understand uncertain
    results. We may ask for a blood and/or saliva sample from close relatives to help 
    understand your/your child’s genetic test result. 
  description: |
    <b>Genetic testing</b> can raise important issues.If an important genetic variant is found,
    you may need to tell your child about this in the future, when they are old enough to 
    understand. For example, the test results may show that your child has an increased 
    chance of developing a particular condition or medical problem. This increased chance 
    does not mean that they will actually develop the condition.
    <br>
    <br>
    We are only searching for genetic changes that are related to your family’s rare genetic 
    condition. However, it is possible that we may find genetic changes responsible for other,
    medically important genetic conditions (incidental findings) that are unrelated to that 
    condition. Overall, the chance of this is low.  However, if we discover that you or your 
    child has a genetic condition for which we have specific treatment recommendations, we 
    will discuss the findings with you. These results might also be important for the medical 
    care of others in the family, such as siblings or parents.  We will also refer you, and your
    family if appropriate, to a genetic counsellor. With your permission, we will share these 
    results with your/your child’s doctors.
    <br>
    <br> <b>Genetic testing – issues for your family:</b> The genetic tests may tell us 
    something about you or your wider family. This could affect you and your family 
    emotionally and interfere with your relationships. For example, by chance, we may discover
    that parents and children or siblings may not be biologically related. While the 
    identification of non-paternity is extremely unlikely, if this is identified, we will 
    not disclose this to you, your child or any family members.  This is in keeping with 
    standard clinical genetics practice.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some people in your family might want to know about your or your child’s results. 
    They may want to know whether the results have implications for them. You can decide
    whether or not you want to tell them about the test results.

    <br>
    <br> 
    If you decide to go ahead with your/your child’s genetic test, this may have implications for
    you or them in the future. For example, you may need to reveal these test results to third parties
    such as insurance companies, employers, and financial or educational institutions.

    Some people find it stressful to get information about their genetic make-up and possible future 
    health issues.
    <br>
    <br>
    Your/your child’s participation in this project could raise personal issues for you. If this happens,
    we can refer you to an independent genetic counsellor. This will be free of charge. We are also 
    available to discuss any concerns you may have.
    <br>
    <br>
    We will keep your/your child’s test results private, but we cannot guarantee complete confidentiality.
    Some genetic variants are very rare, and we aim to publish results from this study in scientific journal
    articles.  Therefore, it may be possible to identify you or your child from the test results or the name of the gene.
    <br>
    <br>
    If the testing shows important information about your relatives, contact with your relatives about the testing
    is encouraged. You may wish to do this yourself or you may ask your doctor to assist you in this if you choose.
