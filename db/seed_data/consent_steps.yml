- title: Consent for the genomic test
  order: 2
  description: |
    We would like to invite you to participate in a research study that is
    explained below. You have been invited to take part in this study because
    you or your child is suspected to ahve a rare genetic condition. Knowing 
    what is involved will help you decide if you want to take part.
    <br>
    <ul><li>Many rare conditions are caused by changes in the genetic information
    in the body.</li><li> New genetic testing technologies have greatly improved 
    the chances of finding a genetic change causing a rare condition.</li><li> This 
    project use these new technologies to look at your/your child’s genes 
    to try find a genetic cause (‘diagnosis’) for the rare condition in 
    your family. This will include looking at the genes of closely related 
    family members (e.g. parents, siblings).</li><li> A genetic diagnosis can help 
    us to better understand your family’s rare condition. This may provide more
    certainty about future health implications. It may help doctors find potentially relevant treatments.</li><li>

  order: 5

    The following questions are optional. You can decide whether you wish to 
    consent to the following choices and your preferences will be saved. You
    can change your preferences at any time.
   <br>
   <br>
   You will also be asked whether you consent to donating you/your child's data
   (health-related, genomic and self-reported information) and sample(s) collected 
   in this research study, for use in other research approved by a registered Human
   Research Ethics Committee. This committee checks that studies are scientifically
   and ethically acceptable. This means that the research respects and protects you
   and the other people who have donated data and/or sample(s).
   <br>
   <br>
   Key information about donating your/your child's sample(s) and data:
   <ul><li> In most cases, you will not be recontacted for further consent.</li><li>
   Access to your data and/or sample(s) will only be granted if approved
   by the study Data Access Committee.</li><li> The research may or may not
   be related to this study. </li><li> If you consent, personal information
   will be removed from your data and sample(s). </li><li> Research findings
   from these studies will not be returned to you. </li><li> Your/your child's
   may be stored on controlled-access national or international data 
   repositories. </li><li> Your/your child's data and/or sample(s) may be shared
   with researchers in Australia or overseas, including at universities, hospitals,
   medical research institutes, not-for-profits, or for-profit biomedical, 
   pharmaceutical or diagnostic testing companies.</li><li> The results of the 
   studies are unlikely to be of direct benefit to you.</li><li> Data will not 
   be shared for marketing or insurance purposes.</li><li>

- title: Consent to research outside this study
  order: 6
  description: |
    Genomic testing is not yet routinely done and we still don’t know a
    lot about genetic changes that cause
    health conditions. Sometimes we would like to share your DNA sample,
    your genomic information or your
    general health information with other researchers in Australia and
    internationally. We will only share this
    information with researchers whose projects meet our criteria and
    have been approved by a Human Research
    Ethics Committee (HREC). A HREC is a group of medical, scientific
    and ethics experts, as well as members of
    the public, who look closely at planned research to make sure it
    is going to be beneficial and not harmful
    to participants.
    <br>
    <br>
    We will remove your personal details from your DNA sample, genomic and
    health information (de-identify
    them), but there always remains a small chance someone could work out
    who you are from your genomic
    information.
    <br>
    <br>
    De-identified samples are coded and so it remains possible to re-identify you.
    We will keep the
    re-identification code with us, it will not be shared. By keeping the code,
    it means that in some cases we
    may be able to contact you if the research finds something that will
    benefit you personally.
    <br>
    <br>
    Whether we share this information outside the current study is your choice, and
    you can use this section to
    change your mind any time you want to. Your answers to these questions will
    not stop you having the genomic
    test.
