    <br>
    The results of this research study will be published and/or presented at scientific and medical 
    meetings. Your information will be provided in a way that means you cannot be identified.
  description:
    OPTIONAL - Images from scientific investigations that do not identify you will be published 
    without requesting additional consent. However, we will contact you if we wish to include any
    clinical photos or images.  We will only publish these images with the formal written consent
    of the participant or parent, who can decide which images (if any) may be used in a research publication.

    Research Ethics Committee. I understand that the project is required to be carried out in line with 
    the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007). 
  description: |
    Your/your child’s health records and any data collected and stored for the research study may be reviewed
    at any time to make sure we are following correct study procedures. This review may be done by the Human Research
    Ethics Committee that approved this research project, regulatory authorities, or as required by law. Your 
    participation in this research study may also be recorded in your health records.
    <br>

  question: |
    I consent to sharing my or my child’s de-identified genomic data with approved national and international databases.
    <br>
    <br>
    All data collected as part of this research study will be stored in secure, controlled-access databases that meet 
    national and international data standards. Stringent security measures will help prevent unauthorised access to or misuse of the data.
  description: |
    Your/your child’s data obtained through this research study:
    <ul><li> will be accessed by those involved in your/your child’s care and personnel working on this study.</li><li> may be 
    released to genetic services to help with the care of other family members, without your identity being revealed to family 
    members. </li><li> will be stored and available for other research studies if you consent to donate your data for this purpose. 
    </li><li> will otherwise remain confidential, except as required or allowed by law.</li><li>
    <br>
    <br>
    Personal information (including your/your child’s name, date of birth and address) will be removed and replaced with a unique
    study code (de-identified). Whenever possible, only the minimum, necessary data will be shared with other researchers. This maintains
    your privacy and allows our research team to link any research findings back to you/your child. This will be important if there are
    findings that have implications for your or your child’s future health care, so that it may be possible to contact you to return these results.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Using your data to advance knowledge</b>
    <br>
    Your/your child’s genomic test results and health data obtained through the research study may also be shared with national or 
    international databases. This improves understanding of human genetics by comparing your results to those from other people.
    <br>
    <br>
    In such cases, your data will be ‘anonymised’. This means that there will be no personal information or study code attached to
    the data and it cannot be linked back to you. Therefore, there is no direct benefit to you/your child, but your data can support
    health advances that benefit others.

    I consent to my or my child’s DNA samples (blood, skin, saliva, other tissue) being analysed for this research.
    <br>
    <br>
    Your genomic sequencing data will be transferred to our analysis tool called seqr for reanalysis.  If no answer is
    found following reanalysis, blood will be sent to the Victorian Clinical Genetics Services (Melbourne) or Garvan 
    Institute of Medical Research (Sydney) for further genomic sequencing and/or RNA sequencing.  
  description: |
    Tissue samples or skin cells will be used for functional studies and depending on what functional studies need to
    be performed, we may send this material to expert research collaborators.
    <br>
    <br> 
    If you are signing this consent on behalf of a child who is less than 18 years of age, when your child turns 18 years
    of age we will not contact them to ask them to re-consent to this research. We ask that you tell them about their
    samples stored for this study when they are an appropriate age.
